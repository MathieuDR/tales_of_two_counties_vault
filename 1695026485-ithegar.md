# Ithegar

This is the capital city of [[1695026669-taeris|Taeris]] and the home of it's Ruler. Right now [[1695026729-jynira-maerwynn|Baroness Jynira Maerwynn]]. 

It's a big flourishing city near the coast that is heavily protected by thick stone walls, a well trained group of city guards and the royal guards protecting the royal family.

Here we have a big mixture of races. Everything from Humans, Dwarfs, Gnomes as well as Tritons and other folk.
