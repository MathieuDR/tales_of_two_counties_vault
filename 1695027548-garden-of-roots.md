# Garden of Roots

Thick and dark forest north of [[1695026485-ithegar|Ithegar]]. It's equally home to satyrs as well as others, mostly bigger things.

It is the source of many adventures, child stories and expeditions. But the name giving Roots and Vines from the Trees makes this a difficult place to explore.

It is said that this forest sprung into existence from the body of [[1695027120-ashor-dragon|Ashor]].
