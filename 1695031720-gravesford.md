# Gravesford

Small and upcomming city in [[1695026460-ashor|Ashor]]. Not many people live here but those who do, love the quite country life.

Being surrounded by both Rivers [[1695027041-river-styx|Styx]] and [[1695031816-river-graves|Graves]] and having the mountains in it's back, makes it some sort of Safe Zone in both [[1695026669-taeris|Taeris]] and [[1695026460-ashor|Ashor]]. That's also the reason why there is basically no walls or palisades surrounding this town
