# The death of the baron

You've been told by [[1695027773-maerwynn-of-taeris-baroness|Baroness Maerwynn]], or as she was refered to "the Lady", that [[1695027745-bedegar-of-ashor-baron|Baron Bredegar]] and all of his family was killed by a group of [[1695039149-white-tusk-clan|white fanged orcs]]. That somehow made it into the [[1695039192-fort-bredegar|Fort Bredegar]] and killed everyone inside leaving [[1695039206-general-saxton|General Saxton]], as General and Commander of Ashors Military in charge of the whole County.

Who was absent at the time as he, and most of Ashors troups where out on a military training that day. This lack of security seems to be the perfect opportunity for the orcs to raid the fort.
She asked the Party, now known as [[1695039283-blitz-kreek|Blitz Kreek]], to help her investigate this incident as it might break off the peace that was so hardly fought for.

[[1695027773-maerwynn-of-taeris-baroness|Lady Maerwynn]] also told you that shortly after three of his Lieutenants where put in charge

[[1695027773-maerwynn-of-taeris-baroness|Lady Maerwynn]] suggest for you start your investigation in the east in [[1695031720-gravesford|Gravesford]] as it's very particular that it got his own ruler, being a very small village.

She also asked for a personal favour:
She admitted that this party is not the first one to investigate this mystery. There have been a group of 5 close friends and allies of her that went missing and she kindly asked if the party could find the whereabouts about these 5.
