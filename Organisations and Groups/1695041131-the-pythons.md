# The Pythons

A group of assassins that have never been seen before and are the source of whispers and nightmares. It is said that they kill without leaving any traces.

## Encounter

The Party was able to catch one of the members and discovered that they all have a magically enhanced snake tattoo that, in case one of them gets caught, bites the wearer in the neck and causes the body to turn to ashes.

This was prevented by a quick separation of the arm and it's owner. Due to an interrogation, the party now knows at least the name of the Pythons Head: [[1695041222-alsira-leader|Alsira]]
