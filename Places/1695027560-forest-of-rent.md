# Forest of Rent

This is [[1695026460-ashor|Ashor]]'s counterpart to [[1695026669-taeris|Taeris]]'s [[1695027548-garden-of-roots|Garden of Roots]] with the difference in size. It's roughly up to twice it size.

It's a dark and narrow place where trees are standing so close together that barely any light touches the ground. People say that, at night, they even saw the trees moving but those were mostly drunks that claimed that.
