# Tarreton

This is the second largest City in Ashor right after [[1694976235-bedegar|Bredegar]]. Due to it's location it's a huge trade hub as most caravans heading towards [[1694976235-bedegar|Bredegar]] to pass the intersection on which Tarreton lies.

It's fortified by stone walls like most cites are but within the city walls you find anything money can buy, from Magic Item Shops, Boutiques that sell the fines clothes, People of all Races selling their company and some say there is even a black market somewhere, where you can buy slaves.
