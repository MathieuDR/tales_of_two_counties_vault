# The Tale of Two Counties

[[1695026669-taeris|Taeris]] in the North and [[1695026460-ashor|Ashor]] in the South with the natural Border of the [[1695027041-river-styx|River Styx]] in between them.

They are named after two ancient gem dragons that fought all their lives. [[1695027091-taeris-dragon|Taeris]] the Saphire Dragon and [[1695027120-ashor-dragon|Ashor]] the Emerald Dragon. In their final fight, their death released so much energy that all the mountains that stood here vanished and created this giant valley and coastline.

Story has it that [[1695027091-taeris-dragon|Taeris]] heart, as it touched the ground after his death, formed [[1695027290-arrowhead-lake|Arrowhead Lake]] and made the Sea Level rise several meters to point where it is today. What happened to the rest of his body got lost in time. Some say it landed in the [[1695027312-stone-belt-mountains|Stone Belt Mountains]] and turned into the spring of the [[1695027041-river-styx|river Styx]] others think it just got vaporized.

[[1695027120-ashor-dragon|Ashor]] on the other Hand, his Body got seperated and where it touched the ground, two mighty Forest sprang into existence. These were later known as the [[1695027548-garden-of-roots|Garden of Roots]] and the [[1695027560-forest-of-rent|Forest of Rent]]. Some say that his body parts can still be found in these woods but everybody who tried to find it, returned either empty handed or not at all.

This was thousands of years ago, way before other races started to settle on these lands.

It didn't take long and with the river between them, these two Counties.. like their name giving dragons... started to fight each other.

And after generations of war, and countless deaths on both ends, between these two, Baron [[1695027745-bedegar-of-ashor-baron|Bedegar of Ashor]] and Baroness [[1695027773-maerwynn-of-taeris-baroness|Maerwynn of Taeris]] finally signed a truce. That was about 5 years ago.

The diplomatic relations between these two are still tense and far away from relaxed but one can at least travel and trade in both lands freely as one wants.
