A Clan of Orcs having the name giving white tusks and lead by [[1695041279-bonebreaker-dorokor|Bonebreaker Dorokor]]. She's a smart and strong leader and rules the clan by the right of the strongest.

The Party discovered that the clan as some huge members known as Juggernauts.

This clan was hired by [[1695039206-general-saxton|Lord general Saxton]] to [[1695038777-the-death-of-the-baron|kill the former Barons and his Family]] for the promise of Land and Supplies. They were later then double crossed by Saxton so that he didn't have to hold up to his end of the bargain.

Dorokor was on the other Hand smart enough to let the Barons Son alive so that Saxtons claim to Rule the county can be reverted.

After a negotiation with the Party in the [[1695040908-castle-ruins-party|Castle Ruins]] inside of the [[1695027560-forest-of-rent|Forest of Rent]], the clan returned to their former territory in the [[1695027312-stone-belt-mountains|Stone Belt Mountains]].
