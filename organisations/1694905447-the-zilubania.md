# The Zilubania

A cloister east of [[1694976235-bedegar|Bedegar]] known for their peaceful mindfulness and gathering of knowledge and lore.

## Magical side gig

Unofficially however it's a place where a handful select students from the lower rings of society are educated in the way of magic. Only students which show a talen are picked to be schooled in the ways of spells, scribing and wizardry. It's very unstructured and dependant on the teacher. All secret students are instructed to act like a monk or nun of the cloister. This is to not draw attention to [[1694976474-two-school-system|Two School system]] enforcers. 

The Zilubania only has the resources to teach 3 stuents at a time. [[1694905442-mr-zylgwyn-loris|Mr. Zylgwyn]] started the tradition as a talented monk himself. The other students and teachers are unknown to all students, even the ones being schooled in magic.
