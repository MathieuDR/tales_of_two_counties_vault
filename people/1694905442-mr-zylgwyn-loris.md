# Mr. Zylgwyn, Loris

Loris Zylgwyn was a monk at [[1694905447-the-zilubania|The Zilubania]] until his mysterious disappearance. He was one of the secret teachers in defiance of the [[1694976474-two-school-system|Two School system]]. Himself he was a wizard being schooled in [[1694976676-academia-caelorum|Caelorum]] before he was kicked out for teaching to non-students. He was transformed into a spellbook that [[1694905688-saelihn-araxisys|Saelihn]] now carries and uses.

He started out by writing 'back' in the book towards [[1694905688-saelihn-araxisys|Saelihn]] untill [[1694905688-saelihn-araxisys|Saelihn]] was so fed up she manifested him forward from the book into a blue ethereal apperiation that everyone could see.
