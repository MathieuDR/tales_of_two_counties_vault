# Bedegar
![[assets/bedegar.png| the view of Bedegar from the Harbor]]

Named of the [[1695038568-royal-family-ashor|The Family]] that ruled [[1695026460-ashor|Ashor]] for now 15 Generations and home of most of the People living in [[1695026460-ashor|Ashor]]. 

This, similar to [[1695026485-ithegar|Ithegar]], is a thriving and blooming coastal city. Although, due to the lower number of guards here, as they're concentrated on the Keep to protect the royal family, criminals are more of a problem here. But they do there best to keep the city and their citizens safe.
