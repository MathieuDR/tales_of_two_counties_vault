# Academia Caelorum

This is one of the two Magical Schools that exist in the Counties. This one being places inside the the City of [[1695026485-ithegar|Ithegar]]. It's hard to get into as you need to have a recommendation of a former student or someone with power to get into.

In contrast to it's counter part, this school started on the path on opening up to everybody with the talent and the coin for it. But as it's not there yet, a recommendation comes a long way.
