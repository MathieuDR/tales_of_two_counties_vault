# Stone Belt Mountains

This high mountain region surrounds all of [[1695026669-taeris|Taeris]] and [[1695026460-ashor|Ashor]]. It's a harsh and dangerous environment and it's the main resource for building materials in both Counties.

There are some Nomadic Tribes that live in mountains but most of the things that live there live by the code "Kill or be killed"
