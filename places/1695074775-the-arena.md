# The Arena

This Arena, just outside of [[1695032181-tarreton|Tarreton]] is known for it's entertaining fights and was lead by [[hargul-half-orc |Hargul]].
At least that is what the party heart so far outside the arena itself, because in this arena [[1695039283-blitz-kreek|the party]] was held against their will after their kidnapping. Together with [[1695075461-kreek-kobold|Kreek]] and some others, the Party woke inside the arenas cells completely robbed. 
During their stay inside this Arena, they found the following Rooms.

## Rooms

### The Stables
These are two Rooms on each side of the Fighting pit of the Arena. They hold up to 11 Monsters on each side and during their time inside the Arena the party fought Velociraptors, a Basilisk, Axebeaks and Blinkdogs that came out of these Stables.
Each Stable has a drain to get rid of what ever these creatures produce while inside the stable

### The Fighting Pit
Surrounded by the audience Ranks and balcony for special guests is the fighting pit in the Arena.  
A huge round area where the floor is covered by hey where the Gladiators fight either against each other or against creatures that where held inside the stables. This Area is surrounded by 9m high walls and what looked like a magical barrier that protects the audience and the other guests from whatever happens inside the fighting pit.
The Party also saw "[[The Champion]]" inside this area during a what looked like a training session but never saw him? ever again.

### Training Room
this is a Room with barely usable weapons and equipment and three training dummies for the Gladiators to use and train.
The weapons inside this room barely deserve the name "weapon". All of the equipment inside here is heavily used, everything that was suppose to protect someone got holes and everything that was sharp at some point is now blunt. 

### The Cells
These are two Rooms with 10 small holding Cells each and this is where the party woke up and found themselves again.
Each Cell is a small 1,5m by 3m and comes with a more or less used pile of hey. The party found several bones inside these piles, indicating that they weren't the first ones to be held here against their will.
There is a big enough path inside these rooms from the Hallway so that people can come in and go out simultaneously. 
Across from that on the other side of the room is a small slit of a window that provides a bit of light for the cells. This window is barred and also protected by a magical barrier, preventing anything to get out of there

### Infirmary 
Lead by Nurse Tyra, this is the place where the fighters that didn't died wake up after they didn't made it inside the fighting pit.
Inside here are 3 comfortable beds so the beaten worriers can rest for a night.
The Nurse also provides a basic healing service together with a fresh water supply.
Although Meirah suspected that it's not that fresh as it had a weird smell to it.

### Hallway
The Hallway connects all the Rooms and has a huge Wooden Gate guarded by [[Tiny]] on one side and the entrance to the fighting pit on the other

### Hargul's Office
This room with a fine hardwood floor is the working space of [[hargul-half-orc|Hargul]], the owner of this Arena.
The painted pictures on the walls present him and his former glories in a very heroic way.
It also has a fire place which provides this room with a steady temperature and warmth. 
The party found, underneath [[hargul-half-orc|Hargul]]'s desk, a small button that deactivated the fire in the fireplace and gave way to a secret storage room.

### The secret Storage Room
In here [[hargul-half-orc|Hargul]] managed to keep a Mind Flayer captive, using the "natural body oils" of it's skin to apply a mind control effect to everybody who drank that water which was given to fighters inside the infirmary or to the audience free of charge.
This is also where [[hargul-half-orc|Hargul]] stored away all the fighters possessions. 
The party freed the Mind Flayer held in here and used him to escape this arena together with [[Tiny]] and [[1695075461-kreek-kobold|Kreek]]
