Meirah woke up in a cell, with a huge headache. Last thing Meirah remembered was ending up in a bar fight in a bar in Taeris and being knocked out. 

- There are other people in other cells: Neiri, [[1695075433-nevrest-thomas|Nevrest, Thomas]], ?
- Bones in cell, Meirah stole a fingerbone to attempt and pick the lock on her cell

Hargul. Half-Orc. Person who runs the arena.
- Behave, rest and fight well
- Followed by dark, shadowy figures

Lord Saxton. Commandor and chief of Ashor. 
- Watched the first fights in the Arena

## Fight 1

We had to fight Kreek, we knocked him unconscious out of mercy. He is always the first victim of newcomers.

Kreek. Kobold. Fellow prisoner of the arena. No will to fight.

## Fight 2
Lizardfolk and a couple veliciraptors. The first thing the Lizardfolk did was throw his spear at the tribune, in the direction of Hargul. It got intercepted by a shadowy figure, who threw it back and impaled the Lizardfolk. This is when Meirah noticed there was a magical barrier surrounding the arena. Evelyn attempted to cast a spell at Hargul, it failed. That’s when everyone got punished with poisonous darts, knocking everyone out.

Arena. This is where the fights take place. 

- Hidden pitfalls: a small layer of water (sewage)
- Magical barrier around arena: no magic goes through

Infirmary. We woke up in bed with a serious headache. Our wounds were treated somewhat.
- The water in the infirmary has a weird smell. 

Tyra. Nurse. She acts very weird, as if she wants to be at the arena. 

## Fight 3

Blue Stone brothers. Pair of Dwarven twins.

Blink dogs. Creatures from the Feywild. 

- Can teleport
    

## Rules of the arena

1. If someone misbehaves, everyone gets punished
    
2. Survive ten rounds, beat the champion and you will be set free.
