## Fight 3
Blue Stone brothers were defeated, they appeared to be illusions. They left a note under Meirah’s armor while duo-grappling her. The Blink Dogs were thrown in pits and killed.

Meirah talked to Tiny. Trying to make conversation, he seems kind. 

Tiny. Half-Ogre guard. 
- Key around wrist


Hargul’s Office. There is a fireplace,  bookshelves, a large desk, an armor rack and there are multiple paintings of Hargul.
- The smell of the strange water is stronger in Hargul’s office  
- Hargul didn’t know that the Blue Stone brothers were illussions
- Hargul stole Nevrest’s necklace
- Hargul cast a spell that petrified Neri

Letter from the Blue Stone Brothers. Mallec of Ashor, not a paladin, but a wizard. The next show is in Tarreton. For his contest, you need a strong mind.

Talk with Kreek. Kreek came to Meirah at night, asking when she was going to get out of here. He asked if she could take him with her if they escaped. Meirah said she would.

- People went into Hargul’s office and disappeared
- Water: makes you want to stay - Tyra has to drink a glass every day
- Champion: fully armored person that killed everyone

After this conversation, Meirah decided to place Neiri’s statue in Hargul’s office. Tiny was asleep and there was no one in the office.
