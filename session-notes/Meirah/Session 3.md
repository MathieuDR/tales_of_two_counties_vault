# Session 3

Hargul’s Office - Hargul screamed, didn’t enjoy Meirah’s surprise, which was Neri as a stone statue. There are new voices near Hargu’ls office, the sound of armor, the smell of herbs, ointment and oils.

 6th of Ukthar : Almost the end of the end of the year. 
- End of the month: Feast of the Moon.
   
Tiny. He drinks the water of the arena every day he comes to work.

Stables. There is a Basilisk on one side, and bird noises on the other side.

Basilisk. Reptile with sharp teeth and multiple legs.

Hargul. He is pissed about Nevrest’s talisman. He said he will take it back after the fight. Meirah and Nevrest got a nickname, scarred fighter is Nevrest, the wolf is Meirah.

Nevrest. The talisman is important to him. He called out to Maelström. Could it be the tentacles?

Meirah carried Nevrest to the infirmary for bandages, while going back to the arena for dragon teeth and scales.

- 2 guard drake teeth
- 4 guard drake scales
- 3 rations of drake meat

Nevrest talked to Tiny and made ‘friends’. The plan is not to have him drink the water.
