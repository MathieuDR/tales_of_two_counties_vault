Hargul came to us, asked Nevrest to give his amulet back. He refused. He then flashed Saehlin’s spellbook. Told us a special fight was coming, not against a stony friend. Saehlin went to Hargul’s Office to steal a book. Leon and Meirah were on distraction duty, but they failed. Nevrest took over. A shadow person joined. Nevrest improvised and got punched. The shadow person than disappeared.

! There is an alarm in Hargul’s Office.

## Fight 

Portcullis closed behind the party. We had to fight shadow figures. Neri was one of them, Meirah recognised him. 

## Escape plans

Kreek has joined us. Meirah asked him about the voice, “Set me free.” He said it showed up before the arena closed down, but then it lived up again. Nevrest tried to convince Tiny to join us as well. 

Kreek also told us that people disappear in Hargul’s Office. There is a bookcase that opens the fireplace, it revealed a secret room. There is a Mindflayer chained above a cauldron, there he is tainting the water with his mind magic.

Mindflayer. Meirah’s instincts tell her this is a dangerous being. Three months ago Meirah heard a story of a Mindflayer crashing into a home while she was on the hunt.

- We freed the Mindflayer

The Maelström. Patron of Nevrest. It saved him from being eaten by sharks, which explains his scars.

The Mindflayer was freed and that caused some chaos, in which the party escaped with Tiny and Kreek. The first thing we heard was: “I can’t believe this. The Orcs killed the Baron!”

# Session 5

Tiny is going to his family in the hills west of Tarreton, he shared with us that it is too dangerous for him to mingle with the tiny people.

Tarreton. Walled, large city. The Las Vegas of Ashor.

- The main gate is closed
- Guards aren’t letting anyone in “Let us in! It is not safe out here!”
- There are carts parked in front of the gate

Baron Bredegar. The ruler of Ashor. He is rumored to have been killed by Orcs.

“By the decree of the new ruler of Tarreton, we cannot let you in.”

Lady Ruth, a lieutenant of Lord Saxton, is now the ruler of Tarreton. She was there when the peace treaty was signed.

General Rudderford. He was also at the peace treaty when it was signed.

A child tried to pickpocket Meirah, the kid then fled to a tent. Meirah tried to catch the scent of the kid, but caught the stench of rotten flesh. 

Gabriel Denton. A fine gentleman wearing a long coat, a hat and glasses. He has shallow white skin, a fine mustache and a thin beard.

- He saw us fight in the arena
    
- Wants to hire us to get into the city, offering 20 gold per person. We have to open the city gate.
    

# Session 6

## Opening the city gate

Crazy session with Meirah and Nevrest, we got our faces on wanted posters!

Collecting a red flower for Gabriel Denton. Meirah and Nevrest’s name gets cleared.

# Session 7

  

# Session 8

## The Unstoppable Manticore

6 days left until the Wizard arrives in the Unstoppable Manticore.

Unstoppable Manticore. Two-story building, with double front doors and smaller doors to the side.

- Lincoln, the barkeep of the Unstoppable Manticore. He is a Leonin, with a scar over his eye.
    
- We rented a big room on the second floor, there were two windows in the room.
    

Mallec of Ashor. According to the innkeep, he is a charlatan. His show moves every day. 

We eventually figured out that the letter contained the following message: “Meet the Paladin in the Unstoppable Manticore in Tarreton. he will have a key, the Lady.”

We talked to the barkeep again, who had a tattoo on his arm of a key. He gave the key to us, after we said we wanted to be taken to ‘the Lady’. 

## Meeting with The Lady

We found ourselves in a cellar, with food. There was a barrel that fits a key, we could pass through after using the key. It was a secret chamber, which contained two Elves. 

- Lady Maerwyn, hooded elf
    
- Unknown Elf, with long dark hair, daggers and intense body language
    

Lady Maerwyn told us she wants to keep the peace. The Baron was murdered, including his family. Lord Saxton is now leading Tarreton, as ‘rightful’ leader since he was the head of the military. Lady Maerwyn paid us all 5 platinum pieces for our allegiance, and aid in her investigation.

- Gravesford (East) is controlled by Sir Peliton. She wondered what the significance was off Gravesford.
    
- Tarreton is controlled by Lady Ruth.
    
- Sir Barlow controls the marine fleet
    

A group was sent out before us.

- Durkelim Galatog, a Paladin of the Order of the Lightseeker. A human man.
    
- Alex Gaardner, a Grave Cleric and keeper of the Maerwyn family crypt.
    
- Monty, 
    
- Bree Copperkettle, a halfling bard.
    
- Hjaldan, a protector. Dwarf with a mohawk and axes.
    

Lady Maerwyn wants us to perhaps find them. But mostly, she wants us to investigate the three above mentioned ‘leaders’.

# Session 9

## Murder at the Travelling Trader

Leon is making Kreek’s armor, while the others go check on the Travelling Trader (Markus Silverstein). Wintermoon (Tabaxi) was the daughter of Markus, she asked us to check up on him. The Traveling Trader is located near the north east gate of the city. There are two windows with general items. There are no lights and the door is left open.

We entered and began investigating, soon finding a dead man behind the counter. He was stabbed 5 à 6 times. Ofcourse as we stand over the dead body, the city guard enters the shop. Saehlin managed to hide, but everyone else was caught with their pants down. We got patted down. The guard that searched Meirah was nervous, she gathered it was his first day. 

## Interrogated by the Warden

We were then interrogated by the Warden, Thea Sicarias. We shared that Wintermoon gave us this ‘quest’ to go look for her father. This was not convincing enough, so Lady Larenhalen made tea for us so we spoke the truth. We shared our story again. The Warden asked us how we got here, Meirah decided to share in length what the group had been through in the arena. When Warden inquired about the letter of Lady Maerwyn, Nevrest got out of the effects of the tea, sharing that he wanted to see the travelling wizard. Markus Silverstein was murdered, but not by us. The Warden believed us and let us go. At the end of the conversation, Meirah asked the Warden if she could look into the arena and Hargul, she handed over the Arena Ledgers, explaining a bit of what had happened to them. 

## Nevrest’s Tale

While we were on the road to Gravesford, Nevrest shared his story. It began when we talked about renting horses from HTS Horses. He said he would rather walk barefoot to Gravesford. We all agreed to walk, but he shared his story at the next campfire. Nevrest isn’t actually his first name, it is his last name. Thomas Nevrest is his full name, but he just goes by Nevrest now. The Nevrest family is a noble family that has a fishing company, they own a fleet of ships. Thomas’ sister, Lana, got married to Anton. Together they had a daughter, named Clara.

Anton was an idiot, he signed a contract with Harry Morren. One of the owners of HTS. It was a contract that if anything happened to Anton and his family, that the company went to Harry. Later the home of Laura and Anton went up in flames. They left behind Clara, who Nevrest secured in a safe place for now. Nevrest is certain that Harry Morren orchestrated the fire that killed his sister and her husband.

HTS Horses. Company that rents out horses to adventurers, owned by: Harry Morren, Tha’dad Earthfinger and Stod Pairhoof.

## Two Stupid Farmhands

The next morning we came upon two farmhands, who enjoyed going to the arena. They were talking about how it was a shame that it was ruined and that the monsters escaped. We talked to them, trying to make them see the arena wasn’t for willing participants. They recognized us. They didn’t listen. Nevrest made them drink themselves to death, probably? by Suggesting they drink the river empty.

When we decided to rest near the forest of Rend, we set a campfire. There were wolves nearby, Meirah spotted them and thought she could scare them away. That was not the case, we fought them and had a lot of wolf meat.. again. 

# Session 10

## Carnival on the way to Gravesford.

Entrance is a giant’s dragon head, that breathes fire through its nose.

“Welcome, I am Panos and this is my carnival.”

Satyr

- Tricksters
    
- Live inside a forest, not that common, they stick to themselves. 
    
- Some form of magic, they like to make music.
    

Incubus - unknown name

- Charming people
    
- Draining their life force
    
- Resistant or immune to thunder
    
- Resistant to slashing, piercing and bludgeoning from non-magical attacks
    

Group of five men, with shortswords and daggers, wearing light armor. ‘That’s weird, it should’ve held them up longer.’ 

# Session 11

## Arrival at Gravesford

The party arrived in Gravesford. As they entered town they noticed Pinna’s Shop and the Relucant Pig. They went for a drink in the Relucant Pig, glad to be in a  town once more. 

With all the stories shared before, it felt like a drinking night. Leon bought an expensive bottle (50 gp) of rum, Kraken Rum. As he was returning to the table, an announcer entered with several guards in tow. Sir Pelliton was among them. The announcer proclaimed that there was a bounty on Whitefang Orcs and Bonebreaker Dorokor. Sir Pelliton then said we shouldn’t worry about it, as he was going to claim the bounty of 500 gold. 

## Meeting Sir Peloton

Before we could drink our expensive bottle of rum, Sir Pelliton drank it in front of us. He has a huge air around him, of self-importance. He treated us like peasants and even called us peasants. Meirah wasn’t having it and she got up, intimidating, but Sir Pelliton was apparently itching for a fight.

# Session 12

## Dealing with Peliton’s Guards

After chasing away Sir Pelliton, the party still had to deal with his guards. Nevrest made one of the guards come alive again, to fight on our side, but no one really noticed due to the helmet. Once they all were down, they disappeared in a bright flash that dealt cold damage to Meirah as she was close. Meirah made sure not to transform into a wolf!

With the guards gone and the party bloodied and beaten, they returned to their seats and drink. The Mayor entered and asked what had happened. He decided to pay the party’s tab for now and as long as we stay in Gravesford. During the drinks, Saelihn bonded with Pinna over magic. 

! BACKSTORY BIT: Leon tried to ask Meirah about her past. Meirah explained how she became a wolf, but was short on the details. She shared that she was chasing Kitt, a bounty she was trying to collect. When she cornered him, he wolfed out and bit her. 

Mayor of Gravesford: Osic

Well dressed, older gentleman.

- Got a letter from the baron: Sir Pelliton is coming
    
- Honest man
    
- Worried about the town’s reputation
    

Sir Pelliton: Knight of the Three Roses

- Magic user:  dimension door, counterspell
    
- Guards disappeared in a black smoke that did cold damage
    
- Wants to claim the bounty on the White Fang Orcs and Bonebreaker Darokor
    

Pinna: Owner of Pinna’s Shop

- Wizard or apprentice
    
- Wears a starry hat
    
- Bonded with Saelihn over magic
    

When we went outside to check up on Pinna, we saw a red glow in the sky as Pinna’s shop was on fire! We ran towards it immediately and saw Pinna getting kidnapped by WhiteFang Orcs.

# Session 13

## Pinna is kidnapped!

In an attempt to quickly chase down the Orcs who got Pinna, we got wet in the river. This failed miserably, except for Leon who managed to cross  safely, the others eventually used the bridge to get over the river. We then had to track the Orcs through the Forest of Rend. It was a very long walk, but Meirah’s nose was able to catch the scent of the Orcs.

We followed it and were ambushed by four Giant Spiders and Four Ettercaps. We fought and defeated them. 

LONG REST in the forest, as we were chilling in our Tiny Hut, created by Saehlin. During her watch, Meirah swore she heard the flapping of wings in the forest. There was a big shadow (20 feet) moving over us. She assumed there was something big flying in the sky (~dragon?)

After another long walk, we finally found the Castle where Pinna was taken by the White Fang Orcs, the Castle of Rend.

# Session 14

## Arrival at Castle of Rend

Castle of Rend.  We inspected the building from the outside, doing a perimeter sweep without getting too close. Saehlin’s crow was very useful in this endavour. 

- South East tower has collapsed
    
- North West tower is filled with guards that are keeping watch
    
- Outer walls around the castle have been damaged and in disrepair
    
- The castle itself feels very old
    

- There were windows, but they have been removed and replaced with wall
    
- There is a hole in the middle of the ceiling, with smoke coming out of it. It is not a chimney, it appears to have collapsed.
    

- Secret tunnel near South East tower
    

## A Secret Entrance

We went in through the secret tunnel near the South East tower, after attempting to send Leon in invisible for scouting. He wasn’t even able to climb up the tower, because he couldn't see his hands. Meirah spotted a secret tunnel as she walked closer. We went through, ending up at a metal door of sorts, it had an inscription in Draconic. Kreek couldn't read it, so Saehlin cast a spell. It said: gold. Meirah licked the wall, and then at Saehlin’s suggestion held a gold coin up to it. This caused the ‘wall’ to move, it was actually a statue, that kept the secret tunnel hidden.

As soon as Meirah walked past the statue the smell in the room was too strong, the whole place smelled like shit. The party contuined to explore, finding a room with two shaman Orcs. We attacked and a fight broke out.

# Session 15

The fight continued, Nevrest cast an epic spell before he fell unconscious, causing the Orcs to disappear in utter darkness. Combined with Saehlin’s Web spell, it was a deadly combination. This caused Leon and Meirah to not have much of a job, as all foes were out of sight. Leon eventually ran into the darkness to test his luck. It turned out alright! Meirah was knocked out by the Spirit Guardians of one of the shamans. The fight eventually ended, but Meirah and Nevrest were knocked out cold. Saehlin and Leon collected loot from the corpses, before dragging us back towards the tunnel. 

# Session 16

Nevrest woke up, but Meirah was still out. There was a tremor in the ground while we were in the tunnel. Saehlin spotted a leg of something really big near the secret trapdoor.  It moved by. Through her crow, Saehlin saw a very large Orc that had a wolf by its side. 

We rested in the secret tunnel, when Meirah woke up again she was annoyed and quiet. The hallway where the fight had taken place had been ‘cleaned’ of the corpses. Meirah was wondering if it was the strange hole that Nevrest spotted, since he saw something move there.

We sneaked into another room, finding Orcs fast asleep. Saehlin, Nevrest and Meirah decided it was best to take them out in their sleep. And so they did. Meirah then dragged the corpses she could carry towards the pit, to test the theory of the monster. It was confirmed after their short rest in the secret room they found next. Leon was with Kreek in the hallway with the animated armor, keeping watch. 

## The Blue Dragon Phalanx

They found another secret room in the hallway where most of the fight had taken place. There was a Shrine to Bahamut. We discovered that this Castle belonged to a secret order of Dragonborn. The Blue Dragon Phalanx. They were elite fighters, but they vanished at some point in history.

There was a chamber past the shrine that had chests in them. Nevrest and Meirah went about opening them. The chests were trapped, and after triggering the first, the duo sorta learned their lesson for opening the next ones. 

- 2148 gold
    
- 220 platinum 
    
- Plate Armor (Leon). 
    
- Silvered Magic Sword (Leon) .
    

! LOCKPICKS BROKE: 8 left

# Session 17

We continued our rampage through the cellar of the Castle. We found two Orcs, standing in front of an altar of Gruumsh in another room. We tried to repeat the sneaky kill routine, but it didn’t work. We still made quick work of the Orcs though. We found a large sapphire that was the size of a first. Meirah gave it to Saehlin, since it felt magical. 

## Crypt with a Wraith

We continued to explore, finding a Crypt. Meirah spotted a Wraith. With what she learned about wraiths, she advised against messing with it. They are dangerous undead beings that can summon specters, but they aren’t good with sunlight.

## Refusal to Surrender

Having nothing left to check on this floor, the party decided to go up the stairs. There they found the pointy end of a spear and a lot of Orcs. “Bone Breaker Drakar wants to speak to you. Surrender.” We decided that we couldn't surrender, not after what happened at the arena. We fought, valiantly, with great effort. But were bested and eventually surrendered. Especially when an Orc with a half-burnt face held a sword at Pinna’s neck. Meirah however was so lost in her werewolf form that she could not see reason. She was knocked out cold and later healed by Saehlin with a healing potion.

# Session 18

## Nothing left but sweet surrender

Bone Breaker Drakar. Female Orc, strong and independant leader. She held an axe to Edward Bedegars neck. 

Bone Breaker Drakar wanted to discuss terms. She had been waiting for us. Pinna’s kidnapping was apparently an invitation for a parley. She wanted our aid in dealing with Lord Saxton. She had made a deal with Lord Saxton to kill the Baron and his family, but she knew it would bite her in the butt. She kept the son of the Baron alive as insurance. 

We had to prove our allegiance, so we gave the blue sapphire to Bone Breaker Drakar. She accepted, she gifted us a horn, and said we could use it once to call upon her and her troops. She and her troops then left the Castle behind. Edward Bedegar and Pinna were left in our care. Edward told us he was thankful, but that he had no payment for us. He did gift us the Castle, which is his right as Baron. We told him that all that matters for us now, is restoring him as Baron and putting Lord Saxton to justice for the murder of his family.

Lord Saxton. Former general of the army of Bedegar. He conveniently ordered the army away, days before the Orcs attacked the Castle. He then became the acting Baron, as there were no surviving members of the Bedegar name. 

We figured out that Sir Barlow has a yellow crystal/glow. Sir Pelliton has a blue crystal/glow. Pinna shared that she overheard that Lord Saxton kidnapped one of Bone Breaker Drakar’s Orcs, to start a parley. But Pinna wasn’t sure anymore what she had heard, it didn’t make a lot of sense to her.

## Another crypted message

While Meirah and Kreek were resting, Saehlin investigated the room the parley was in. She found a weird looking note saying: 

PAIH-EBESA-LOOV-LUNE-ITHT-TTIH-OHSR-NEWE-KBAE-NOYD-OYYA-WHOY-SEUS

This we deciphered as: “Pelliton knows about the boy, he is on his way you have three days”. Meirah took a look at the paper and estimated that the letter was one to two days old. We decided that we had to gather supplies to protect the Castle from an incoming attack. Saehlin, Nevrest and Pina traveled back to Gravesford to gather those. 

## The Moonweaver’s Request

Leon, Meirah and Kreek stayed behind with the Baron. An eclipse happened while Leon and Meirah were discussing how to best protect the Baron. It was an exception, the eclipse was not expected in the lunar cycle. It felt weirdly out of place. It was a sign from the Moonweaver! Meirah froze in place and her eyes became a starry night sky, as the eclipse happened above her. She had a vision of the Moonweaver, who asked her to become her champion in the fight against evil forces in the world

- The Moonweaver showed Meirah four evil shadows, with red eyes and a glowing core (blue, yellow, green and red). The one with the red glow was slightly bigger than the other three. Behind those four was an even bigger shadow, the size of a building, with the same red eyes. 
    
- Meirah deduced that: blue = Sir Peliton; yellow = Sir Barlow. Guess is that red is Lord Saxton and green is Lady Ruth. 
    
- Sir Peliton is on his way to the castle, so that is very convenient to defeat that evil
    
- Meirah said she felt like she had to kill those forces, but wanted everyone's aid.
    

! BACKSTORY BIT: when Meirah talked about the gigantic shadow, she clutched her necklace and her voice broke. It was clear that she has a personal issue to settle with whoever that shadow might be.

## A Castle that is ours to keep

When the others returned with the townsfolk, Jargo looked at the damage done to the Castle. He was disappointed with us for taking such bad care with it. We explained we only just acquired it. He decided that one of the rooms would become his smithy, if he were to help with the repairs. No one dared to argue. 

We told Pinna that her shop burned down, but she wouldn't have to worry about it, since she could live in this castle now. She will get her own ‘wizard tower’. She was very excited about this. 

## Preparing for a Fight

When Leon and Meirah were discussing tactics of defense and moving around tables and beds to better fortify the palace, the Wraith from downstairs floated through the floor. As soon as it touched the light, it changed into a crystal Dragonborn. Behind it came 18 specters that later became Dragonborn warriors. The spirit spoke to Leon: “You cleared our home from these Orcs and menaces… We will help you defend this castle.” Leon asked the spirits to alert him should they spot any strangers coming nearby.

Meirah used her newfound magic to place a Glyph of Warding on the front door of the Castle. This in the hopes of surprising Lord Pelliton when he arrives and tries to open the door. 

# Session 19

The party waited and guarded for the arrival of Sir Peliton and his goons. Some time after midnight, they arrived. He demanded the door to be opened and that the baron would come out, casting multiple fireballs on it. The door got hurt, but remained. Sir Peliton’s goons came and opened it, they were hurt by the Glyph of Warding, and then demolished by a thunderous fireball from Saehlin. The Woman in Red cackled as she disappeared from sight, only to reappear next to Nevrest, leaving a bag on the ground. 

“Kill him. My coven will get to you later.”

! PAST COMING TO BITE US IN THA BUTT: Red Flower woman, we stole from her.

We then continued our fight against Sir Peliton. He fell to his knees, severely hurt, and then he screamed. He smashed the blue gem against his armor and began to transform into a large blue humanoid monster, with long claws. His wounds healed. 

Lord Peliton was changed into an evil being, he was a host for an evil power and most likely accepted a pact. Probably with the gargantuan shadow that Meirah saw in her vision. 

Final words of Sir Peliton: “Tasar won’t be pleased.”

Ghosts flew out of the broken shards, being released on Peliton’s death. There were many, many souls released. The last one was Hjaldar, a stocky Dwarf with a mohawk and two handaxes. He spoke to us: “Seems like I have to thank you for this. I was trapped in there long enough...” 

Hjaldar was sent out with the other adventurers. He didn’t remember much. He tried to find out something about Soulstones, but he isn’t sure why anymore. Bree Copperkettle sent him on this mission. He had a view of what Sir Peliton was doing, through the crystal in which he was captured.  

- Who is Sir Peliton in league with: woman with a green crystal shard (Lady Ruth?) + big guy with heavy armor
    
- Do you know what happened to your companions? No, I’m not sure. We.. had a paper with a riddle. We split up, we tried to figure out what Soulstones are. 
    
- Is there someone you would like us to tell of your passing? I’m not sure.. I think there was someone,  but it was so long ago.. Just find the others. I really hope tey didn’t suffer the same fate as I.
    

Soul Stones: four soul stones, they give the people that wear them power. They are really hard to destroy if it is not the owner itself destroying it. 

## Bag of Holding turned inside out

- Papers with scribbles
    
- Papers and ink
    
- Dungeoneering kit
    
- Common clothes
    

Riddle on one of the papers

"In ruins old, where shadows creep, Seek ye a path, secrets to keep. Amidst the trees, where whispers play, A verdant path shall guide your way.

Follow the stream that glistens bright, Its song shall lead you through the night. To reach the haven you desire, Embrace the path where embers fire. 

With every step, let courage bloom, And trust the stars that light the gloom. When moon and stars align above, A pond with a waterfall, the oracle's cove. 

In waters clear, your questions ask, The oracle's wisdom, your soul unmask. Through trials faced and paths untrod, The truth awaits, within the pond with a waterfall of the gods.” 

Spell Scroll inside the papers: doesn’t make sense, starts with one spell and then switches mid sentence to another spell. It is gibberish. Different sort of paper than other spell scrolls, five different spells, but none of them are complete. 

Leon’s sister got kidnapped, not that we know yet! But he received a mental message from his sister, stating that she got in trouble. 

"Hey Big Brother, I hope this works. I got kidnapped. I'm somewhere in Bedegar. They have snakes. Need help. Come fast please. Amelia"

# Session 20

DON’T FORGET! Meirah bought 4 potions of healing from Pinna. She will have them ready in a week. 

Leon shared that his sister was in trouble, after behaving erratically and running around the castle. 

Zentharim. Criminal organisation. They keep winged snakes as pets.

Amelia. Leon’s sister. The creative one of the family.  Blonde curly hair, green eyes, freckles. Front tooth is crooked, she feel as a child.

The party all bought horses from people in the Reluctant Pig, so they wouldn’t have to rent horses from HTS Pony’s.

- Spirit. Meirah’s horse.
    

Poster of our faces behind the bar in the tavern. “They are trouble.”

Saehlin talked to herself and a small ghost sitting on her bedpost. Saehlin acted weird when Meirah cast ‘Turn Undead’. She shuddered, normal people don’t shudder when this magic spreads. She doesn’t look undead, but for some reason, she feels it.

Sending to Amelia: Meirah here. Two days away. Where were you taken to? Who took you? Are you hurt? What snakes? You can reply to this, Leon.

- Reply: People have snakes on arms. Taken in front of the shop. I’m fine. They want money. It’s dark. Please hurry, I am afraid.
    

Second sending to Amelia: Why you? Who do we pay, how much, where? How did you contact your brother? Are there others taken? How long ago were you taken?

- Reply: They saw the last package. I don’t know. They gave me a scroll. Told me they want more. It’s been five days. Please hurry.
    

Justin Case. General goods.

# Session 21

Third sending to Amelia: On our way. How are you holding up? Leon is very worried about you.

- Reply: Thank you. I’ll manage. That’s sweet. Can’t wait until you get here. 
    

We were watched by two Tabaxi as we were resting, they killed off Saehlin’s raven. We saw yellow eyes in the trees. They ran off as soon as the sun showed up. 

Bedegar Keep is looking rough, there has been a fight. Most of the damage is being repaired, people are working hard on it. 

HTS ‘Prize of Bedegar’. Horse race in Bedegar that takes a full day.

Sir Barlow is in the docks at Bedegar, near The Topaz Eye. Looking at papers, his back is turned towards us. He shouts commands, before he walks onto the ship, preparing to sail off. 

Nevrest and Meirah both reached out to their contacts. Nevrest gave three gold to his drunk contact, that went out to gather information. Meirah talked to the barkeep, and gave him four gold for information and a message for those that kidnapped a child of Tanner’s Tanners. 

# Session 22

## Investigation at Tanner’s Tanners

Tanner’s Tanners. In Merchant District. Store run by Leon’s family, leatherworkers.

- Tobias Tanners. Leon’s father
    
- James Tanners. Brother of Leon. Works in the store as well. 
    
- Elisa Tanners. Leon’s Mother.
    

Insight on Leon: he isn’t afraid of his father. He is just afraid of dealing with his family.

Person that bumbed into us and left a note with Nevrest: 

- Scent: fine perfume, smoked wood. 
    
- Clothes look simple, but are fine made.
    

Note on Nevrest: Order soup at the Wounded Scoundrel.

Academia Silvarium. School that teaches magic. Sponsorship and talent is needed to get inside the school. In Bedegar. In here skill is inherited and you're nothing without a name.  This leading to strong line of magic user that is rumored to have access to the oldest and darkest secrets known and forgotten to history.

- Seal: shield with a castle surrounded by a forest. Blue sky in the back.
    

Last letter was a month ago.

Midday visit: 3 to 4 days ago Amelia told Tobias that she was going to study at Academia Silvarium. Avrid Stonehart visited and shared that he would sponsor Amelia’s scholarship. He said he saw talent in her. 

- Lean looking human (could also be another race) - 1m80
    
- Pale face, white fluffy hair. 
    
- Fine and well made clothes.
    
- He had a seal of the Academia Silvarium
    

The Backwater Bloodhounds Bureau. A name that Nevrest came up with at Meirah’s suggestion. They use this for their investigations. 

We visited the Academia Silvarium. The Guard didn’t let us in, as we didn’t look like students. We tried to convince him, but that didn’t work. Meirah said that they were investigating a teacher, the guard responded that the Academia Silvarium did their own investigation. Leon then said he was with the army, the guard repeated that the Academia Silverium didn’t fall under its jurisdiction.  

Tipsy Tinkerer, Inn in the Merchant Disctrict. Lots of mechanisms and gears are lining the walls, they constantly move. One silver for a common room. One gold for an apartment, bath included.

- Silvia, barmaid
    
- Eldric Copperclock, clerk
    

! BACKSTORY Meirah prayed to the Moonweaver, and then shared her latest adventures to her amulet. There was a warm breeze coming through the open window, surrounding Meirah with a warm feeling.

Rumors at the tavern:

- HTS Pony’s Event: annual event - they were glad that it was organised.
    
- A guy threw himself in the port, drinking up water. Saying he had to drink all of it.
    
- Some woman’s clothing that was out of season.
    

The Wandering Wand. Magic shop in Bedegar.
