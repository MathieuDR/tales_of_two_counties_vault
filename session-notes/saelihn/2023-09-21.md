## RECAP
Leon met his family again, especially his dad. Admitted it might be his fault she got kidnapped, guilt trip of his life. 

She was recruited to the [[1694976661-academia-silvarum]], we tried to get into. We failed to get into

We got a clue to get soup at a shady place.

## Session

Nevrest rolled a nat 20+7 with a guidance of 3. For 30% discount. We got 558 Gp each.

When we were walking to the [[Wounded Scoundrel]] somebody yells if we're "Thunder creek". [[1695075433-nevrest-thomas|Nevrest, Thomas]] replies that it's "Blitz Kreek". [[1695075415-meira|Meira]] notices it's an ambush by all the doors and windows closing.

There is a pet drake, The lady with the glasses does a spell.

The lady is a woman with darker skin and dark hair. White strands. Dark blue robe. I teleport her 90ft away.

The wizard summoned a steed and ran over the water. Phantom steed is sadly 1 min casting time.

First time doing my hypnotic pattern it was a bit of a let down.

The caster had the following items
- Soaked spellbook
- ![[Pasted image 20230921224853.png|A note]]
- common poisonous reagent
- 9 sp

Meira writes a note, putting on the chest, with hand on top

> Don't mess with BlitzKreek!

When we get in the Wounded Scoundrel, it's really small and a female half-orc is at the bar.

The menu on the wall, has "soup & ale", it's also very stinky.
