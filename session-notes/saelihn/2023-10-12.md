# Saelihn session note
We're at the wounded scoundrel, with a half orc behind the counter. It's smelly, dirty and not a whole lot on the menu.

Nevrest orders bad soup, good soup and 3 ales. Which results in 3SP. She yells the order in the kitchen. The good and the bad soup is exactly the same, and the source of the smell.

While [[1695075444-leon|Leon]] is socialising with the bar lady, [[1695075433-nevrest-thomas|Nevrest, Thomas]] is fake feeding his zombie/skeleton and throws it away.

Leon goes into the kitchen, together with Zylgwyn on his shoulder. There is meat everywhere, but it's pretty dry, burned meat. Meat is green and moldy.

Leon tries to compliment the chef, which brightens his day and smiles. He grabs a torch and open a secret door.

There is an amazing tavern, with a fireplace crackling, harp playing. Pale guy brooding. Group of sofa's with weird looking elfs (eladrins). They're all talking and enjoying the music. At the bar is a well dressed gnome gentleman, very well maintained beard.

There is an expensive (100g) bottle, and no interesting conversations.

The menu is quite gibberish, but using comprehend languages I can read the menu

**Appetizer**
- a noble woman wants to help her mistress and husband find a new room underground 100g
- The local farmer is convinced the neighbour cursed his land, 45g
- ... more

Meirah toke the note, of our hit, and I poofed raven and zylgwyn out of existence. She asks me to check out the paper to see if it's similar. The paper has the same zhentarim watermak, not the paw watermark. It now dawns on me that it's the Zhentarim, and put a bounty on us.

When trying an apatizer, there might be a hunt on us if we can't finish it. Leon bolts out after learning he ate humanoids, Nevrest pukes and bolts after Leon and Meirah. Saelihn says her goodbyes and hurries up a bit faster.

Being out of ideas, we're going back to Tanners Tanners and somebody is being thrown out that Meirah needs. There is a bag with very nice smelling crab soup.

It's a place from the wealthy district with a huge mansion, close to the waterfront. In the wealthier part of town.

Tobias is more suspicious that he doesn't know because of the story.

We get inside the mansion and are being charmed with calmness and no worries. But we get greeted with HTS Pony.
